# Development Process

The portfolio website was developed using Visual Studio Code as the main code editor.

### 1. Project Setup
A project folder was created to store index.html, style.css, and an images/ directory. VS Code was used for writing and testing the code.

### 2. HTML Structure
The HTML file was built by adding sections such as:
- Header and navigation bar
- Hero/Introduction section
- About section
- Projects or Work section
- Contact section

### 3. CSS Styling
A separate style.css file was created to style all elements. The design focused on clean layout, spacing, proper fonts, and colors to make the portfolio attractive and readable.

### 4. Testing & Adjustments
The website was previewed in a browser and improved through multiple adjustments to layout and styling.

### 5. Version Control with Git
Git was initialized in the project folder, and meaningful commits were created throughout development. These commits were pushed to GitHub.

### 6. Final Upload
The entire project folder was uploaded to a GitHub repository with proper documentation, .gitignore, and screenshots included.
